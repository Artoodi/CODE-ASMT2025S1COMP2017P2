We are developing a new service aimed at revolutionising document editing. To achieve 
this, we must implement a server-client architecture where a central server hosts the 
document and coordinates all client interactions. Multiple authorised clients will be able to 
send commands to the server to edit the document concurrently.
The document format will be a modified version of Markdown. Content will be stored as 
plain text using only ASCII characters, simplifying compatibility and transmission.
The server will always maintain the most up-to-date and accurate version of the document.
